<hl>welcome to the division 2</hl>

<p>i have chose this game because i have had experience with creating a website and i know the information about the game and also i play this game with my mate and we love it. this game is better for us because the player comes on straight away and it says an agent has joined your team or it normally says my mate has joined your team. you dont need to invite the player on the game but you can if you want to but me and my mate just go on to the game and the player is there</p>
